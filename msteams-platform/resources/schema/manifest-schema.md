# App manifest schema for Teams

The Microsoft Teams app manifest describes how your app integrates into the Microsoft Teams product. Your app manifest must conform to the schema hosted at [`https://developer.microsoft.com/json-schemas/teams/v1.16/MicrosoftTeams.schema.json`](https://developer.microsoft.com/json-schemas/teams/v1.16/MicrosoftTeams.schema.json). Previous versions 1.0, 1.1,...,1.15, and the current version is 1.16 are each supported (using "v1.x" in the URL).
For more information on the changes made in each version, see [manifest change log](https://github.com/OfficeDev/microsoft-teams-app-schema/releases).

The following table lists TeamsJS version and app manifest versions as per different app scenarios:

[!INCLUDE [pre-release-label](~/includes/teamjs-version-details.md)]

The following schema sample shows all extensibility options:

```

The schema defines the following properties:

## $schema

Optional, but recommended—string

The https:// URL referencing the JSON Schema for the manifest.

## manifestVersion

**Required**—string

The version of the manifest schema that this manifest is using. Use `1.13` to enable Teams app support in Outlook and Microsoft 365 app; use `1.12` (or earlier) for Teams-only apps.

## version

**Required**—string

The version of a specific app. When you update something in your manifest, the version must be incremented too. This way, when the new manifest is installed, it overwrites the existing one and the user receives the new functionality. When this app was submitted to the store, the new manifest must be resubmitted and revalidated. The app users receive the new updated manifest automatically within few hours after the manifest is approved.

If the app requests for permissions change, the users are prompted to upgrade and reconsent to the app.

This version string must follow the [semver](http://semver.org/) standard (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH).

## ID

**Required**—Microsoft app ID

The ID is a unique Microsoft-generated identifier for the app. You have an ID if your bot is registered through the Microsoft Bot Framework. You have an ID if your tab's web app already signs in with Microsoft. You must enter the ID here. Otherwise, you must generate a new ID at the [Microsoft Application Registration Portal](https://aka.ms/appregistrations). Use the same ID if you add a bot.

Please be aware that the ID is case sensitive, in so far as the ID in this manifest has to match the ID in the Microsoft Bot Framework, exactly.  Code and JSON editors may apply capitalisation rules which might change the ID in the manifest; this will not match the ID in the Microsoft Bot Framework. 

The ID stored in Teams Admin Center is the **External App ID** and it is visible as **ExternalID** on the traces.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are submitting an update to your existing app in AppSource, the ID in your manifest must not be modified.

## developer

**Required**—object

Specifies information about your company. For apps submitted to the Teams store, these values must match the information in your store listing. For more information, see the [Teams store publishing guidelines](~/concepts/deploy-and-publish/appsource/publish.md).

|`termsOfUseUrl`|2048 characters|✔️|The https:// URL to the developer's terms of use.|
|`mpnId`|10 characters| |**Optional** The Microsoft Partner Network ID that identifies the partner organization building the app.|

## name

**Required**—object

The name of your app experience, displayed to users in the Teams experience. For apps submitted to AppSource, these values must match the information in your AppSource entry. The values of `short` and `full` must be different.

|Name| Maximum size | Required | Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|`short`|30 characters|✔️|The short display name for the app.|
|`full`|100 characters|✔️|The full name of the app, used if the full app name exceeds 30 characters.|

## description

**Required**—object

Describes your app to users. For apps submitted to AppSource, these values must match the information in your AppSource entry.

Ensure that your description describes your experience and helps potential customers understand what your experience does. You must note in the full description, if an external account is required for use. The values of `short` and `full` must be different. Your short description can't be repeated within the long description and must not include any other app name.

|Name| Maximum size | Required | Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|`short`|80 characters|✔️|A short description of your app experience, used when space is limited.|
|`full`|4000 characters|✔️|The full description of your app.|

## localizationInfo

**Optional**—object

## icons

**Required**—object

Changing these permissions during app update, causes your users to repeat the consent process after they run the updated app. For more information, see [Updating your app](~/concepts/deploy-and-publish/appsource/post-publish/overview.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Permissions are deprecated now.

## devicePermissions

If your tab configuration or content UI navigates to any other domain other than tab configuration, that domain must be specified here.

Do **not** include the domains of identity providers you want to support in your app. For example, to authenticate using a Google ID, it's required to redirect to accounts.google.com, however, you must not include accounts.google.com in `validDomains[]`.

Teams apps that require their own SharePoint URLs to function well, includes "{teamsitedomain}" in their valid domain list.

>
> When using wildcards, the following rules apply:
>
> * If a subdomain segment includes a wildcard, it must be the only character in the segment.
> * Any segment preceding a wildcard segment must also be a wildcard segment.
